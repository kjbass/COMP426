        The story of Orpheus is one that many a soul has been told.  It is about how the power of music can sway hades,<br>
        but also about how man is flawed and cannot properly trust.  It is a story of heartbreak, as well as a story about music.<br>
        It is a story all about how Orpheus's life got flip turned upside down.  It is a story of how even the beauty of music <br>
        cannot be enough to save a loved one from the depths of hades.
