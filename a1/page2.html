                Usually no living beings were allowed in, <br>
                but our singing protagonist sang his way past the evil beast guarding the entrance!<br>
                He sang and he sang, and the beast got out of his way, for his music was that of true true beauty.<br>
                hooooowhee, was it nice.  Why oh why was the singing so nice you ask?  That's a great question, I'm not really sure. <br>
