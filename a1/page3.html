        The Lyre is a plucked instrument that was played primarily played by common folk <br>
        <br>
        Orpheus, though his music was mighty, was still a common man.  <br>
        <br>
        Because of that, he played the lyre.

        The lyre is a very beautiful instrument, beautiful enough to even woo Hades, unfortunately<br> if you return to the page all about eurydice
        one can learn about why he failed.  <br> <br>
        <h5>It was not because of his music.</h5>
